TJ3-syntax-sublimetext2
=======================

This is the very short readme how to install the syntax highlighting for JaskJuggler 3 using Sublime Text 2.

USING:

for highlighting only you will have to put at least the following files in your user directory:
TJ3.sublime-settings
TJ3.tmLanguage

under Windows XP the user directory is at:
C:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\Application Data\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User

under Linux the user directory is at:
~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User

While compiling the json file wit sublime under windows i notices the .tmLanguage extension had all lowercase characters. Please make sure the the 'L' in .tmLanguage is uppercase. If needed, change manually.

DEVELOPING:
Please add or enhance the language file.
